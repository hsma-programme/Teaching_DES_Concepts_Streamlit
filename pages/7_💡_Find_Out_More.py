A Streamlit application based on the open treatment centre simulation model from Monks.T, Harper.A, Anagnoustou. A, Allen.M, Taylor.S. (2022)

Original Model: https://github.com/TomMonks/treatment-centre-sim/tree/main

Allows users to interact with an increasingly complex treatment centre simulation

    There's so much to teach you about DES that we just couldn't fit it all into our sessions - so we wrote a book!

    The DES book is a free eBook that takes you from your first models through to much more complex modelling concepts than we cover in the taught sessions.

    We'd love to [hear from you](mailto:info@hsma.co.uk) if you find the book useful, or if there are additional concepts you would like it to cover.

    Finally, this whole exercise website has been written in Streamlit - another topic we cover on the course!
    Streamlit allows you to create highly customisable websites that allow you to share results with users and give them the freedom to interact with powerful Python code without needing Python on their own computers.

    You can view our streamlit training [here](https://hsma.co.uk/hsma_content/modules/current_module_details/7_git_and_web_development.html)

    Session 7B gets you started on writing Streamlit apps, and 7C helps you to build and deploy a discrete event simulation front-end just like this one!
